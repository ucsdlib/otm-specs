      The One To Many (OTM) Specification defines two APIs to support communication between digital content
      repository systems (Repository) and distributed digital preservation systems (DDP). These APIs work in tandem
      to allow content captured in Repository systems to be copied to DDP systems for preservation. The
      APIs defined are the <a href="otm-gateway.html">OTM Repository Gateway API (Gateway)</a> for the Repository and the
      <a href="otm-bridge.html">OTM Bridge API (Bridge)</a> for the DDP. The Gateway and the Bridge APIs handle intermediary
      communication between the Repository and DDP and allow each system to operate without any knowledge of the internals of
      the other system. Each API is designed to facilitate deployment either as part of or extension to the Repository (in the
      case of the Gateway) or the DDP (in the case of the Bridge) or as a stand-alone application. They each provide an
      HTTP-based approach for authentication, communication, and data transfer.

      The descriptions and diagrams below reference the <a href="otm-gateway.html">OTM Repository Gateway Specification</a> and
      <a href="otm-bridge.html">OTM Bridge API Specification</a> and are intended to capture the context in which the API calls
      are expected to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DDP workflow assumes an intermediary service which transforms data from the OTM Bridge into something
      usable by the DDP and handles queries for OTM actions to perform. The implementation of this
      piece will be dependent on the architecture of the DDP, and is only a separate service in order to
      delineate the operations which are likely required by a DDP.</p>
    <p>Additional notes are provided for the minimum required steps for implementation in Chronopolis.</p>

    <h2>Status of This Document</h2>
    <p>This document is an appendix to a specification, created as part of the One to Many grant, funded by the Andrew W.
    Mellon Foundation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Initialize</h2>
    <p>The initialization operation allows a DDP and Repository to connect their respective OTM Bridge and OTM Gateway applications
       so that data can be transferred between the two systems.</p>

    <section>
    <h3>Flow</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        An agreement is reached between a repository owner and DDP system that will allow repository content to be deposited
        into the DDP; appropriate SLA/MOU and other legal documentation is signed and arrangements for billing/invoicing are made
      </li>
      <li>
        The DDP administrator calls the Bridge <a href="otm-bridge.html#add-account">Add Account</a> endpoint to add the
        repository to the Bridge system and generate the credentials needed for the repository's Gateway to connect to the Bridge
      </li>
      <li>The DDP administrator provides the Bridge credentials to the Gateway administrator</li>
      <li>
        The Gateway administrator enters the Bridge credentials into the Gateway and the Gateway calls the Bridge
        <a href="otm-bridge.html#register">Register</a> endpoint to provide the Bridge with the details necessary to make calls
        back to the Gateway
      </li>
    </ol>
    </section>
  </section>

<section>
  <h2>Audit</h2>
  <p>The Audit workflow retrieves actions taken on filegroups that have been deposited. It is expected that the Audit Log will
  be maintained by the OTM Bridge and will contain events provided by the DDP.</p>

  <p>See also: <a href="audit-appendix.html">Audit Event Appendix</a></p>

  <section>
  <h3>Flow</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The Repository manager selects an object and requests a preservation audit history</li>
    <li>
      The Repository calls the Gateway <a href="otm-gateway.html#get-object-audit">GET Object Audit</a> endpoint for the object
    </li>
    <li>
      The Gateway calls the Bridge <a href="otm-bridge.html#get-audit-log">Get Audit Log</a> endpoint, specifying the object ID
      as the filegroup identifier
    </li>
    <li>
      The Bridge gathers audit data for the given filegroup and associated files from its internal data store and responds to
      Gateway with the requested audit history data
    </li>
    <li>
      The Gateway translates the Bridge audit data into a format familiar to the repository and responds to the Repository
      request
    </li>
    <li>The Repository displays the audit data to the Repository manager</li>
  </ol>

  <section>
    <h2>Deposit</h2>
    <p>The Deposit workflow describes the process when an OTM Gateway requests that a filegroup be preserved.</p>
    <p>As part of this workflow, a version identifier is passed from the OTM Gateway through the system so that a deposit can be
    related to a point in time. It is up to the DDP to determine how to store this information in a manner suited for long term
    preservation.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>System to System Flow</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The Repository administrator selects a set of objects to be deposited</li>
        <li>
          The Repository calls the Gateway <a href="otm-gateway.html#deposit-object">PUT Object</a> endpoint once for each
          object to be deposited; this starts the deposit process
        </li>
        <li>
          The Gateway resolves each object into a set of files to be deposited; each file is either copied to the Gateway staging
          storage area or a link to the file is captured to allow transfer to the Bridge
        </li>
        <li>
          The Gateway calls the Bridge <a href="otm-bridge.html#deposit-content">Deposit Content</a> endpoint using the object
          ID as the filegroup identifier and providing an identifier for each file to be deposited
        </li>
        <li>The Bridge initiates a deposit action for each filegroup in the deposit request</li>
        <li>
          For each file in each filegroup the Bridge calls the Gateway <a href="otm-gateway.html#transfer-file">GET File</a>
          endpoint to transfer the file to the Bridge staging storage location
        </li>

        <li>
          As each file transfer into the Bridge staging storage completes, the Bridge compares the checksum of the transferred
          file to the checksum provided in the deposit request; any mismatches trigger a re-transfer
        </li>

        <li>
          Once all files in a filegroup are in Bridge staging storage and all checksums are validated, the status of the
          deposit is updated to <a href="otm-bridge.html#deposit-status">`DEPOSIT_STAGED`</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          The DDP calls the Bridge <a href="otm-bridge.html#list-deposits">List Deposits</a> endpoint on a regular schedule
          to check for new deposits in the <a href="otm-bridge.html#deposit-status">`DEPOSIT_STAGED`</a> state
        </li>

        <li>
          For each staged deposit in the Bridge the DDP copies the files from Bridge staging storage into the DDP ingest pipeline
          and performs a deposit (and replication)
        </li>
        <li>
          When the deposit into the DDP is finished, the DDP calls the Bridge <a href="otm-bridge.html#complete-deposit">
          Complete Deposit</a> endpoint to inform the Bridge that the deposit is complete
        </li>
        <li>The Bridge clears the files associated with the completed deposit from Bridge staging storage and transitions the
        deposit into a completed status</li>
        <li>
          The Gateway calls the Bridge <a href="otm-bridge.html#get-deposit-status">Get Deposit Status</a> endpoint in order
          to provide the Respository administrator with deposit status information
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>DDP Workflow</h3>
      <p>The DDP portion of the Deposit workflow assumes that the OTM Bridge has already performed initial processing in order
      to prepare the filegroup for ingestion into a DDP.</p>

      <h4>Chronopolis Implementation Notes</h4>

      <p>New Deposit</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Query the OTM Bridge for incoming deposits
          <ul>
            <li><a href="otm-bridge.html#list-deposits">GET /deposit</a></li>
          </ul>

        <li>
          Extract `filegroup-id` set from deposits response
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for the Deposit based on the `filegroup-id` in Chronopolis
          <ul>
            <li>Expect there to be no existing object in the DDP with an identifier of `filegroup-id`</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure space exists in Chronopolis for this Deposit
          <ul>
            <li>If reserving space, an API needs to be built similar to the [[APTrust-Volume-Service]]</li>
            <li>Otherwise wait for staging filesystem to have available space</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Package the Deposit for Chronopolis
          <ul>
            <li>Create an OCFL Object</li>
            <li>Create ACE Tokens</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use Chronopolis Ingest API to distribute the Deposit</li>
        <li>

        <li>
          Extract `filegroup-id` set from deposits response
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for the Deposit based on the `filegroup-id` in Chronopolis

            <li>Expected to find existing content based on this flow</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Request to have the Deposit re-staged
          <ul>
            <li>Should only need OCFL metadata (inventory.json)</li>
            <li>This could also handle storage reservation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the json response from the OTM Bridge:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mint a new version using the `version-id` from the OTM Bridge
              <ul>
                <li>The OCFL Object version will increment as usual</li>
                <li>Store the version from the OTM Gateway in the `inventory.json`</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New files will be added to the OCFL inventory and distributed in full</li>
            <li>Existing files referenced in the OCFL inventory that have not been modified will not be redistributed</li>
            <li>Files omitted from the json response will not be included in the current version</li>

  <h2>Delete</h2>
  <p>The Delete workflow handles removing data from a DDP. It is assumed that this will be an operation
  which is non-recoverable and permanently removes data from a DDP.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>System to System Flow</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>The Repository manager selects an object to be deleted from preservation storage</li>
      <li>
        The Repository calls the Gateway <a href="otm-gateway.html#delete-object">DELETE Object</a> endpoint for the object
        to be deleted
      </li>
      <li>The Gateway calls the Bridge <a href="otm-bridge.html#get-deposited-content">Get Deposited Content</a> endpoint and
      resolves the object into a set of files to be deleted</li>
      <li>
        The Gateway calls the Bridge <a href="otm-bridge.html#delete-content">Delete Content</a> endpoint with the list of files
