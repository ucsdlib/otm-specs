        The One To Many (OTM) Bridge API Specification is one of two APIs used to support communication between
        digital content repository systems (Repository) and distributed digital preservation systems (DDP) in
        order to facilitate depositing, deletion, restoration, and auditing of digital content managed by one
        or both systems. The APIs defined are the OTM Repository Gateway API (Gateway) for the Repository and
        the OTM Bridge API (Bridge) for the DDP. The Gateway and the Bridge APIs handle intermediary
        communication between the Repository and DDP and allow each system to operate without any knowledge
        of the internals of the other system. Each API is designed to facilitate deployment either as part of
        or extension to the Repository (in the case of the Gateway) or the DDP (in the case of the Bridge) or
        as a stand-alone application. They each provide an HTTP-based approach for authentication,
        communication, and data transfer.
