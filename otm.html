      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      The wide adoption of digital repository software by cultural heritage organizations has led to significant increases in effective management and access to digital assets. While these software systems may provide some digital preservation features, the digital materials and their associated metadata managed by such systems need to be preserved in a way that ensures they will persist over time. This project addresses this need by developing a specification for an integration model that will allow libraries and archives to seamlessly deposit system content into distributed digital preservation systems (DDPs) such as Chronopolis, APTrust, and LOCKSS. This project is funded by the Mellon Foundation.

        <h3>Specifications</h3>
        The One To Many (OTM) Specification defines two APIs to support communication between digital content repository systems (Repository) and distributed digital preservation systems (DDP) in order to facilitate depositing, deletion, restoration, and auditing of digital content managed by one or both systems. The APIs defined are the OTM Repository Gateway API (Gateway) for the Repository and the OTM Bridge API (Bridge) for the DDP. The Gateway and the Bridge APIs handle intermediary communication between the Repository and DDP and allow each system to operate without any knowledge of the internals of the other system. Each API is designed to facilitate deployment either as part of or extension to the Repository (in the case of the Gateway) or the DDP (in the case of the Bridge) or as a stand-alone application. They each provide an HTTP-based approach for authentication, communication, and data transfer.
