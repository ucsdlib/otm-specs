# OTM Diagrams

The files found in this directory represent the diagrams used throughout the specs. There are two
files per diagram - the [Mermaid script](https://mermaidjs.github.io/#/) and the `.png` which is
generated by the [Mermaid cli client](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli/).

## Example 

Generating the image for `audit_content.mmd` as a png, with a width of 800px and a transparent 
background:
```
mmdc -i audit_content.mmd -o audit_content.png -w 800 -b transparent
```
