    <h2>Audit Log Events</h2>
    <p class="note" title="">
      The audit log events are still in the early phases of being fleshed out and understood. The
      current iteration of events and fields were created in a small break out group during an in
      person meeting.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3>Ingest</h3>
      The Ingest event represents the Ingestion of content from a OTM Gateway by a DDP.
      This event can represent either an Filegroup being Ingested or a File being ingested.

      <table id="ingest-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field Name</th>
            <th>Note</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>Identifier associated with the Filegroup or File</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>The version identifier of the Filegroup or File which was ingested</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Timestamp</td>
            <td>The timestamp (ISO-8601?) of when the Ingest event completed</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Checksum</td>
            <td>The checksum recorded by the DDP at Ingest</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Bytes Ingested</td>
            <td>The number of bytes ingestd for the Filegroup or the File</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Files ingested</td>
            <td>The number of Files ingested</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p class="note" title="Question">
        Should this be split into two discrete events? One for the Filegroup ingestion and one for the File.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Replication</h3>
      The Replication event represents the distribution of an Filegroup or a File to a single
      location within a DDP.

      <table id="replication-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Note</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>Identifier associated with the Filegroup or File</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>The version identifier of the Filegroup or File which was replicated</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Timestamp</td>
            <td>The timestamp (ISO-8601?) of when the Replication event completed</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Replicated To</td>
            <td>The the Filegroup or File was replicated to (URI?)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Fixity</h3>
      The Fixity event represents an action taken by a DDP in order to validate that the
      File they have received in an Filegroup has not been changed. This can occur at any
      point in the lifecycle of the File.

      <table id="fixity-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Note</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>Identifier associated with the File</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>The version identifier of the Filegroup or File which was checked</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Timestamp</td>
            <td>The timestamp (ISO-8601?) of when the Fixity event occured</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Calculated Fixity</td>
            <td>The Fixity value calculated according to the algorithm used</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Algorithm</td>
            <td>The algorithm used to validate the File</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Fixity Result</td>
            <td>Boolean value indicating success or failure of the event</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>


      <p class="note" title="Question">
        Should have a discussion on the usage of the word 'fixity'. It seems to imply both
        the check for a File being what is expected as well as the generated message digest.
        The field `Calculated Fixity` could be changed to `Calculated Digest`, with a `Digest
        Algorithm`. We already use `Checksum` in other events, so maybe that would fit better.

    <section>
      <h3>Deletion</h3>

      Fill out with description of what deletion means.

      <table id="delete-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Note</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>Identifier associated with the Filegroup or File</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>The version identifier of the Filegroup or File which was deleted</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Timestamp</td>
            <td>The timestamp (ISO-8601?) of when the Delete event occured</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Checksum</td>
            <td>The checksum value of the File which was deleted</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Repair</h3>
      The Repair event is a process which the DDP resolves any File corruption internally.
      Although this is internal to the DDP, it is something a Repository might be interested
      in knowing about.

      <table id="repair-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Note</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>Identifier associated with the Filegroup or File</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>The version identifier of the Filegroup or File which was repaired</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Timestamp</td>
            <td>The timestamp (ISO-8601?) of when the Delete event occured</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Repair Outcome</td>
            <td>The result of the Repair</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Restoration</h3>
      Restoration is an event which occurs when the Repsitory requests an Filegroup be retrieved
      from a DDP in order to idk.

      <table id="restore-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Note</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>Identifier associated with the Filegroup or File</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>The version identifier of the Filegroup or File which was restored</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Timestamp</td>
            <td>The timestamp (ISO-8601?) of when the Delete event occured</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Success</td>
            <td>The result of the Restoration</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>From</td>
            <td>The location in the DDP where the Filegroup or File came from</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
