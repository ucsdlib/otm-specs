    <p>
      This document defines a set of events that can be used and extended to communicate status about content that has been
      deposited into a DDP through the OTM Bridge. Each event describes an action which has occurred within the DDP and is
      associated with content that has been deposited through the OTM Bridge. The set of all events associated with one
      deposited entity (filegroup or file) is considered to be that entity's audit log. This audit log is available for each
      deposit via the OTM Bridge <a href="otm-bridge.html#get-audit-log">Get Audit Log</a> endpoint.

    <h2>Status of This Document</h2>
    <p>This document is an appendix to a specification, created as part of the One to Many grant, funded by the Andrew W.
    Mellon Foundation.</p>

    <h2>Audit Log Events</h2>
    <p class="note">
      The audit log events listed in this document are based on initial discussions between representatives from Chronopolis
      and APTrust and should be considered in draft form as additional discussions with other DDPs may uncover differences in
      auditing practices.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3>Ingest</h3>
      <p>The Ingest event represents the ingestion of content from an OTM Gateway by a DDP. This event can represent either a
      filegroup being ingested or a file being ingested.<p>

      <table id="ingest-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field Name</th>
            <th>Note</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>Identifier associated with the filegroup or file</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>The version identifier of the filegroup or file which was ingested</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Timestamp</td>
            <td>The timestamp of when the Ingest event completed</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Checksum</td>
            <td>The checksum recorded by the DDP at Ingest</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td>The algorithm used to generate the checksum</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Bytes Ingested</td>
            <td>The number of bytes ingested for the filegroup or the file</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Files Ingested</td>
            <td>The number of files ingested</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Replication</h3>
      <p>The Replication event represents the distribution of a filegroup or a file to a single location within a DDP. This should
      occur for each copy of the filegroup regardless of whether or not it is the primary copy or not.</p>

      <table id="replication-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Note</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>Identifier associated with the filegroup or file</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Version</td>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Fixity</h3>
      <p>The Fixity event represents an action taken by a DDP to validate that a deposited file received as part of a
      filegroup has not been changed. This can occur at any point in the lifecycle of the file.</p>

      <table id="fixity-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Note</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>Identifier associated with the file</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>The version identifier of the filegroup or file which was checked</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Timestamp</td>
            <td>The timestamp of when the Fixity event occurred</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Checksum</td>
            <td>The checksum calculated according to the algorithm used</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Checksum Algorithm</td>
            <td>The algorithm used to validate the file</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Fixity Result</td>
            <td>Boolean value indicating success or failure of the event</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Deletion</h3>
      <p>A Deletion event represents the removal of one or more files from DDP storage.</p>

          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>

      <h3>Repair</h3>
      <p>A Repair event occurs when a DDP resolves any file corruption. Although this is internal to the DDP, it is
      considered to be an event that may be auditable.</p>

      <table id="repair-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>

        </tbody>
      </table>

    <section>
      <h3>Restoration</h3>
      <p>Restoration is an event which occurs when the Repository requests a filegroup be retrieved from a DDP.</p>

      <table id="restore-fields" class="simple">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
