      <p>
        The One To Many (OTM) Gateway API Specification is one of two APIs used to support communication between digital
        content repository systems (Repository) and distributed digital preservation systems (DDP) in order to facilitate
        depositing, deletion, restoration, and auditing of digital content managed by one or both systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The preservation Gateway functions as an aggregating cache for preservation requests originating with a repository
        and destined for a DDP via the  Bridge. This allows repositories to synchronously send content preservation in an
        asynchronous deep archive.
